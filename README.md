# Meteorological Disasters in the USA
EDA with heatmaps (from the Folium library) and a t-test to evaluate the effect of an emergency management bill on the damages caused by different types of storms in the US.

NOTE: GitHub does not display Folium maps, so you can use https://nbviewer.org/ to render my notebook.
